Here, we present a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of aqueous NaCl solutions confined between graphene functionalized with -COOH, -OH, =O, and -CH3 groups across multiple surface coverages and electrolyte concentrations. We systematically disentangle how functional group identity and abundance independently shape interfacial layering, ion adsorption, and water dynamics. Polar, hydrogen-bonding groups (-COOH, -OH) strongly structure the interface and suppress water mobility, while nonpolar groups (=O, -CH3) lead to more diffuse, mobile profiles. Importantly, we show that functional group chemistry sets the morphology of interfacial structure, while coverage scales its intensity, a distinction that holds across electrolyte concentrations. These findings enable a quantitative framework for designing chemically heterogeneous surfaces that precisely modulate ion and solvent behavior in complex electrolyte environments.", "date": "2025-07-17T13:25:09.927Z", "doi": "6878424f23be8e43d69477bc"},

Regardless of their handedness, the chiral Cu electrodes exhibit a lower onset potential for CO2RR compared to their achiral counterpart by suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at the chiral electrodes is significantly lower than that at the achiral electrodes, whereas formate is only produced on the chiral electrodes. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity indicates that carriers traveling through the helical structure become spin polarized, inducing an electron spin accumulation at the electrode surface, which provides the evidence that the topological structure of the electrocatalyst causes the spin polarization. This spin polarization reduces hydrogen formation due to the Pauli exclusion principle for two-electron bond formation and thereby promotes CO2 reduction to CO and formate. Our findings provide insights into the potential of chiral catalysts for controlling selectivity during CO2RR as well as other valuable reduction reactions involving nitrogen or CO where hydrogen evolution also is an undesired side reaction.", "date": "2025-07-17T12:44:54.532Z", "doi": "683a48dac1cb1ecda06eec99"},

We investigate how the ratio of weakly associating anions (TFSI–) to strongly associating anions (NO3–) affects ion transport within the electrolyte. Our findings reveal that the anion ratio significantly impacts both the solvation structure and the solvation dynamics, which together contribute to the distinct transport behavior observed in these systems.

{"title": "Electrochemical Crystallization in Aqueous Electrolytes: Unlocking the Complex Chemistry of a Seemingly Simple Molecule", "authors": ["Kent Zheng", "Stephen Fuller", "Evalyn Wilber", "Susan Moseley"], "abstract": "Compared to other synthetic routes, electrochemical synthesis offers unique control over reaction kinetics, allowing precise modulation of the driving force and reaction rate, dictated by the electrode potential E and current density J, respectively. Most electrochemical systems rely on a liquid electrolyte to conduct electrical current through the concerted motion of ions. Ideally, this liquid phase remains chemically stable under the applied potential. Among all solvents, water (H2O), unsurprisingly, was the first used for electrochemical systems due to its non-toxicity, abundance, and exceptional ability to dissolve and dissociate ionic salts. Despite its early dominance, research shifted toward nonaqueous electrolytes—such as organic solvents and ionic liquids—because of their wider electrochemical stability windows, enabling the deposition of a broader range of materials. However, interest in electrochemical crystallization from aqueous electrolytes has resurged; this is largely driven by two factors. First, water’s environmental friendliness makes it attractive for large-scale and sustainable applications. Second, water’s inherent reactivity—primarily due to spontaneous proton production (H_2 O ↔ H^+  + 〖OH〗^-)—presents both challenges and, counterintuitively, unique opportunities. In particular, recent research into emerging aqueous battery chemistries based on in-situ electrochemical crystallization of metals such as Zn, Cu, and Sn at the anode, and compounds like MnO2 at the cathode has offered exciting new insights into the associated complex interfacial phenomena. Drawing in part on advances from the battery field, this Review aims to offer perspectives on tailoring aqueous systems for the electrochemical synthesis of crystalline matter. In contrast to nonaqueous systems, the proton-induced reactivity in aqueous electrolytes introduces additional complexities. Continuous gas generation and pH-induced precipitation can lead to porous, passivating interphases, posing significant challenges to precise control. However, this same proton activity also enables the formation of a diverse library of materials—such as oxides and hydroxides—that are often inaccessible through nonaqueous electrochemical paths. These aqueous crystallization processes offer a cost-effective and highly controllable approach for synthesizing critical materials for energy and sustainability applications such as electrochemical energy storage. In this Review, we first explore the key physicochemical processes involved in aqueous electro-crystallization of metals, a simpler group of materials with well-defined lattice structures and stoichiometries. We then turn our attention to critical considerations for growing more complex compounds, characterized by intricate lattice symmetries and stoichiometries. We argue that achieving precision control in aqueous electrochemical crystallization requires a holistic understanding of proton activity, its influence on crystallization, and the ability to regulate interfacial chemical kinetics and transport phenomena across multiple length scales. With such control, electrochemical crystallization in aqueous systems offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the precision synthesis of materials essential to energy technologies and sustainability.", "date": "2025-07-17T12:13:05.298Z", "doi": "68780895fc5f0acb528c93cb"},

A comprehensive suite of electrochemical techniques (chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) and surface characterization methods (SEM, XRD) was employed. The results revealed that WW exhibited enhanced cathodic activity and the formation of a more stable, protective surface film on SS316, attributed to complex ionic interactions that mitigate chloride-induced corrosion. In contrast, SS316 in the NaCl solution showed significant susceptibility to passive layer breakdown and localized corrosion. EIS analyses further confirmed improved interfacial stability and restricted charge transfer in WW over time, in stark contrast to the progressive passive layer degradation in NaCl. Surface analyses corroborated these findings, showing limited surface attack in WW compared to distinct localized corrosion features in NaCl. These findings indicate that competing ionic species in WW effectively mitigate chloride aggressiveness, enhance SS316 stability, and suggest improved electrode longevity and reliability for practical electrochemical phosphorus recovery applications.", "date": "2025-07-17T11:18:19.165Z", "doi": "6877190a23be8e43d66d76a7"},

This review highlights the fundamental principles of EGB formation and explores their expanding role in enabling diverse and selective organic transformations such as alkylation, trifluoromethylation, Steven’s rearrangement, Wittig reaction, esterification, addition reactions, anionic chain reactions, macrolide formation reactions, polymerization, C—H deprotonation and functionalization, condensation reactions, and elelctrocarboxylation etc. EGBs efficiently activate substrates bearing labile protons, facilitating the formation of reactive intermediates that can participate in key bond-forming reactions—including the synthesis of heterocycles, fluorinated compounds, and valuable intermediates in pharmaceuticals and materials science.\nBeyond expanding synthetic capabilities, EGBs enhance both regio- and stereoselectivity, contributing to higher reaction precision. While batch electrolysis has been the dominant platform, recent advances in flow electrochemistry offer significant benefits, including improved control, safety, and scalability. Innovations such as “ex-cell” reactor designs—where oxidation and reduction are spatially separated—further increase efficiency and reduce undesired side reactions.\nImportantly, the choice of green-compatible conditions, including electrode materials (e.g., magnesium), solvents, and electrolytes, greatly influences EGB performance and sustainability. As electrochemical methods continue to evolve, EGBs stand at the intersection of synthetic innovation and green chemistry, offering scalable, selective, and environmentally responsible solutions for future molecular design. However, despite their practicality, the use of electrogenerated bases in organic transformations is frequently limited by various factors such as narrow substrate tolerance, electrode material compatibility, sensitivity to reaction conditions, and the requirement for specialized electrochemical setups.

Chalker"], "abstract": "Organic polysulfide polymers are highly useful materials with emerging high-value applications as cathode components for Li-S batteries, optics for infrared imaging, sorbents for heavy metal remediation, and novel anti-microbial agents. Despite the increasing use of these sulfur-rich polymers, there are limited methods to synthesize them with control of structure and molecular weight. In this study, we disclose novel photopolymerization methods to make poly(trisulfides) with well-defined sulfur-rank and stereochemistry, narrow dispersity, and controlled molecular weights. The reaction features photochemical cleavage of an S–S bond in a 1,2,3-trithiolan (a cyclic trisulfide) to generate a diradical that can undergo ring-opening polymerization. To generate polymers with molecular weights exceeding 20,000 g/mol, spatial or temporal control of irradiation is required because the same wavelengths of light that initiate the reaction also cleave S–S bonds in the target polymer. Spatial control of photoinitiation was achieved using a photochemical flow reactor that physically separates the polymer products from the light source after synthesis. Temporal control of photoinitiation also allowed these polymers to be made in batch reactors. This control was imparted with pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation with precisely controlled on and off times. This innovative strategy allowed initiation during short (100 ms) bursts of light, and propagation during longer dark periods (e.g. 900 ms). The pulsed light strategy allowed preservation of the polymer chains during the reaction. In contrast, continuous irradiation led to cleavage of S–S bonds in the polymer and rapid depolymerization. Previously published attempts to make a poly(trisulfide) by photochemical ring-opening polymerization were not viable because continuous irradiation always resulted in depolymerization; our spatially and temporally controlled irradiation methods solve this long-standing problem and provide ready access to decagram quantities of several poly(trisulfides). The reversibility of the polymerization also prompted us to develop new applications of these polymers as recyclable coatings and adhesives, and photoresists for lithography. More generally, we argue that spatial and temporal control of irradiation during photochemical reactions should be considered as a design principle in photochemical synthesis. Pulsed laser techniques have long been used for the study of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions, but the deliberate control of irradiation on and off times has seldom been applied to preparative chemical synthesis. Our photochemical polymerizations using pulsed light reported here illustrate the value of controlling irradiation in space or time to make useful products not accessible with continuous irradiation.", "date": "2025-07-17T10:45:58.072Z", "doi": "6877042723be8e43d66b976a"},

However, the high-valence cations present in most highly conductive solid electrolytes facilitate reductive decomposition at low potentials, leading to significant irreversible lithium-inventory loss. Preventing this requires the development of solid electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable at low operating potentials, while providing high ionic conductivity and sufficient oxidative stability. To realize this, we explored a new family of Li-rich antifluorite irreducible solid electrolytes, Li2.65S0.35NxP0.65-x, the first reported nitrido-phosphido-sulfide, and investigated their application in all-solid-state batteries. We find that the optimized composition Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 possesses a remarkably high ionic conductivity of 1.05 mS cm-1 as well as a relatively high oxidative stability of 1.15 V vs. Li/Li+ for this class of materials. Ab initio molecular dynamic and density functional theory simulations reveal that the enhanced Li-diffusion is the result of enlarged diffusion bottleneck sizes. These are a consequence of, (i) substitution with smaller anions or (ii) increased electrostatic repulsion from the substitution with high-valence anions. Importantly, the oxidative stability makes Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 exhibit good compatibility with Si anodes, and in conjunction with the high ionic conductivity, this enables a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.2% as well as stable cycle life of a full cell with a micron silicon-Li2.65S0.35N0.15P0.5 anode and a LiCoO2-Li3InCl6 cathode.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used but remains slow, expensive and difficult to scale. This work presents a multi-channel and multi-frequency electrical response (MMER) technique that delivers equivalent impedance-related insights at a fraction of the time and cost. MMER enables the simultaneous diagnosis of entire battery modules in just one second, independent of cell count. It uses a binary multi-frequency excitation signal, easily implemented on compact hardware such as programmable logic devices. And bypasses the need for complex impedance fitting or frequency-domain conversion. Instead, MMER directly compares raw voltage responses under a shared excitation current to detect performance variations. Experiments demonstrate that MMER accurately identifies cell performance and health, consistent with EIS results, while reducing measurement time by over 99%. It also supports diagnostics during high-rate cycling without the need for steady-state conditions.

Our investigation shows both bond exchange and plasticization contribute to the reduction of Tg. Additionally, the bond exchange relaxation exhibited a dual Arrhenius-like behavior, which was attributed to the rapid incorporation of free amines as the temperature increased.

Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)-T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (μC*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)-T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the μC* product declines sharply. The enhancement in μC* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (μ), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Using nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM), we visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in μC*. Overall, our study highlights polymer blending as a promising strategy for improving the performance of n-type OMIECs.", "date": "2025-07-16T07:10:19.903Z", "doi": "6875d71d728bf9025e822a49"},

Copper-based electrodes are uniquely suited for this purpose yet achieving high selectivity toward C–C coupled products such as ethylene, over undesired byproducts like methane and hydrogen, remains a major challenge. For CO₂ reduction to ethylene, we introduce here a modular hybrid electrode architecture composed of copper nanowires (CuNWs) coated with a thin, functional organic shell formed via electroreduction of ethylene-bridged dipyridophenazine (dppz) dication derivatives. This core–shell system enables fine-tuning of the interfacial catalytic environment through rational molecular design. We demonstrate that subtle structural variations affecting the electronic distribution of the phenazine moiety, particularly electron-donating or hydrophilic substituents, have a profound impact on the ethylene selectivity. Notably, electrodes incorporating electron-donating groups achieved nearly a tenfold increase in Faradaic efficiency for ethylene relative to pristine CuNWs, while hydrophilic functionalities favored hydrogen production and suppressed C₁ and C₂ products. \nEx-situ characterization of core-shell electrodes further reveals that that the polymeric coating stabilizes the Cu surface against corrosion and provides valuable insights into the structural reconstruction of CuNWs during the electrocatalytic process. Our findings highlight a powerful and scalable approach for decoupling catalyst selectivity from the intrinsic properties of the metal surface, offering a tunable platform for next-generation CO₂ electroreduction.

Yet recent studies reveal that under reactive conditions, catalysts can undergo substantial restructuring -- often dynamic, geometrically and compositionally complex -- that escapes the reach of the conventional static view of catalysis. These phenomena often involve an ensemble of transient, irregular, and heterogeneous surface structures and require sampling a broader set of accessible configurations. Still, even this expanded view can fall short when the system is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium picture. This perspective reviews the growing body of experimental and computational evidence for such non-equilibrium restructuring phenomena. We categorize the scenarios where the system can be stranded, kinetically trapped in metastable regimes and never thermalize, as well as their physical origins. The restructuring arises not only from the intrinsic dynamics of the catalyst but also from the complex interplay with interfacial species, spawning a zoo of restructuring pathways of various chemical nature, sizes, and time scales. To meet the growing complexity, we outline promising directions in computational chemistry, machine learning, and integration with experiments.

Systematic variation of solvents and ion-pairing conditions reveals critical factors to achieve plasmon-induced molecular condensation for diffusing molecules at room temperature. The resulting condensed phase exhibits higher density exceeding that of conventional thermodynamic equilibria, indicating the emergence of a distinct adsorption phase driven by highly localized field perturbations.

Turnover frequencies (TOF) suggest that the HER catalytic activity of Rh sites is comparable to or higher than that of pure platinum surface atoms. Mutual arrangement of the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on the catalytic site, in scenarios with protonated and nonprotonated terminal groups of the nanoflake, can serve as an electrocatalytic efficiency criterion.

Recent work showed that 19F NMR spectroscopy can probe organic electrolyte environments in the layered MOF Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), revealing that the chemical shifts of in-pore anions are influenced by specific chemical interactions with the MOF functionality. Here, we expand this approach to study ion adsorption in a range of layered MOFs and study the factors influencing the in-pore chemical shifts. We find that all MOF–electrolyte systems display positively shifted in-pore electrolyte resonances, with calculations indicating that both aromatic ring currents and metal-centre-induced currents significantly contribute to the observed shifts. We also find that paramagnetic MOFs exhibit additional paramagnetic shifts of the in-pore resonance when specific MOF–electrolyte interactions are present, with paramagnetic NMR calculations linking these to specific coordination geometries and revealing ion binding sites. Finally, MOF particle morphology also strongly affects the appearance of the NMR spectra, with rod-like morphologies leading to slower exchange and better peak resolution.

However, conventional treatments rely on dip coating approaches using polymer dispersions containing fluorinated compounds (i.e. polytetrafluoroethylene), which are environmentally hazardous and result in heterogeneous surfaces with ill control over the wetting properties and limited durability. Here, we introduce a facile method that exploits the facile electroreduction of 4-nitrobenzodiazonium tetrafluoroborate to generate aryl radicals and initiate a radical chain reaction that enables the grafting of vinylic-terminated organosilicon compounds. This method proceeds under ambient conditions and at milder potentials than traditional vinylic electrografting. We study three organosilicon derivatives – allyltriisopropylsilane, acryloxymethyltrimethylsilane, and monomethacryloxypropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane -  as electrografted coatings to tailor surface wettability. We perform microscopic, spectroscopic, contact angle measurements, and electrochemical characterization to correlate chemical moieties with the resulting wettability and electrochemical performance in fuel cells. We find that the electrografted coatings form a covalently-bonded, thin layer which significantly reduces the solid surface energy of the carbonaceous substrate, reaching values close to those of polytetrafluoroethylene. Additionally, we find a correlation between surface energy and fuel cell performance, where the less hydrophobic coatings show cell flooding at wetter conditions.

Our AM1 reparameterization yielded unexpectedly large improvements, and our findings indicate that derived geometrical reference functions are ill-suited for parameter optimization and may also inadvertently incentivize smaller force constants for chemical bonds.

Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations can offer detailed information on the interfacial reaction processes over multiple timescales. However, conventional KMC methods employing on-lattice models and pre-defined event lists are inappropriate for modeling SEI formation due to the complex chemical environment at materials interfaces. In this work, we propose an off-lattice on-the-fly KMC (OTF-KMC) method integrated with a machine learning force field (MLFF) to investigate SEI growth at atomic-level. We study a system comprising a Li(100) surface and an electrolyte containing the ethylene carbonate (EC) and Li salts, and identify various decomposition pathways of EC molecules and PF_6^- anions to generate SEI. Our results show that the SEI features a spatial distribution of an inorganic inner layer near the Li electrode with organic products relatively far from the surface, aligning closely with experimental evidences.

We find that electrodes with deprotonated M–O and M–S groups exhibit significantly enhanced capacitances with alkali metal cations, most notably Li+, compared to tetraethylammonium (TEA+), while no enhancement is observed for MOFs with protonated M–NH groups. The largest capacitance increase is seen for MOF electrodes with metal–hydroxy linkages paired with Li+ electrolytes, which we attribute to strong Li–O interactions and improved charge screening. This mechanism is supported by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments and molecular simulations, which reveal specific Li+ binding at oxygen-rich sites, while operando X-ray techniques rule out cation intercalation as a contributing factor.

We investigate the composite Ni/Ni¬3S2. First, simulated annealing of a previously generated Ni/Ni3S2 heterostructure uncovered S-diffusion to the Ni surface. Grand canonical calculations indicate pristine Ni may be lightly covered by OH at alkaline conditions, in contrast to Pt/Pd, and reveal that S prevents OH adsorption. Static calculations showed no significant effect on kinetics. Using metadynamics to dynamically sample the Volmer step, we show an alignment in entropic effects on Ni and Pt. Low-temperature sampling on Ni resulted in a significantly lower barrier indicating a dependence on solvation consistency. Our characterization of the Ni and Pt interfaces from unbiased ab initio molecular dynamics show similar solvent structures, further supporting this line of thinking. Finally, calculations on OH- and S-modified Ni surfaces found that the former had a greater Volmer barrier by 0.16 eV. This OH-modified surface had a significantly less consistent solvation environment, with an average hydrogen bond lifetime 14 fs less than that of the S-modified surface. These results suggest that the enhanced activity of composite Ni/Ni3S2 originates from adsorbed S on Ni preventing OH-binding and the associated decline in interfacial solvation.

At oxygen-evolution potentials, similar oxidised nickel states were present before and after the Fe incorporation, with negligible change in their redox potentials.

A direct supply of CO to an electrode surface for CO reduction is an effective way to enhance the selectivity for C2+ products, but strategies are still needed to limit the concentration of water at the electrode interface and hence the hydrogen reduction reaction (HER). In this work, we investigate the impact of metal-organic framework (MOF) coatings and electrolyte composition on the microenvironment at copper electrodes as well as its ability to suppress HER. Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrochemical experiments, we examine how NU-901 and ZIF-8 coatings influence solvent structuring, including CO and water coordination at the electrode surface. Experimental results show that MOF-coated copper electrodes exhibit lower Faradaic efficiencies for ethylene and methane production compared to bare copper. NU-901, with larger pores, allows more access to CO and water but favors hydrogen evolution over CO reduction, reducing selectivity for C2+ products. ZIF-8, with its smaller pores and hydrophobicity,1 restricts water coordination but does not improve C2+ formation.

However, the atomistic origins of variations in ionic conductivity with composition remain poorly understood. A key challenge in computationally designing high-performance glass electrolytes is the absence of an efficient general interatomic potential, particularly for mixed-anion systems, such as combinations of oxides, sulphides, and halides. To address these limitations, a machine learning interatomic potential for glass electrolytes is introduced, based on the atomic cluster expansion descriptor, covering common network formers, modifiers, and anions. Excellent agreement with experimental structure and property data across a wide range of glass compositions is observed. While the potential is broadly applicable to, e.g., lithium-ion conductivity, focus is here on the influence of glass composition on sodium-ion conductivity given the emerging importance of these conductors. By screening the diffusivity of 1,303 glass compositions, the presence of anion species, such as sulphides and halides, is found to have a large positive influence on diffusivity, enabling prediction of highly conductive glasses with mixed anions.

Complementary optical modelling and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) reveal chromium oxide deficiency in surface films over PSZs, consistent with established pitting mechanisms.

In practice, solution-phase molecular tumbling makes alignment of external (applied) EFs with a dipolar catalyst challenging, limiting application of EFs in catalyst design. Enzymes impose local oriented EFs on constrained substrates to obtain enormous catalytic accelerations (10^19), but interrogation of EFs in such complex systems remains difficult. Supramolecular enzyme mimics offer a compact, tuneable solution to studying and exploiting oriented EFs in cavities, as long as catalysis is well-oriented. Here, we show that a recently prepared organic cage enzyme mimic is an ideal scaffold for understanding EF-promoted catalysis due to a precisely aligned covalent intermediate. Using theory, we (i) establish the applied field axis that accelerates the rate of an acyl transfer reaction inside the cage; (ii) demonstrate a significant 71% of the applied EF is translated to a reduction in the reaction barrier; (iii) show that strategic placement of charged substituents on the cage exterior creates local EFs that accelerate catalysis through-space, overcoming the problem of molecular tumbling; (iv) identify modified catalyst candidates with cavity field strengths comparable to enzyme active sites (~0.2 V/Å) and a predicted 10^2 rate enhancement over the parent cage, representing a 50% field conversion.

Here, we combine machine-learning screening with constant-potential density functional theory simulations to systematically investigate CO dimerization on dilute CuM(100) alloys. p-Block metals, particularly Al and Ga, make the reaction exothermic and lower the activation barrier relative to pure Cu, with Al showing the highest activity. Charge analysis along the reaction path reveals that electron donation from these heteroatoms stabilizes the CO dimer intermediate, enabling efficient C–C coupling under operating conditions. This behavior is captured by a strong linear correlation between reaction energy and excess surface charge at fixed potential, introducing a physically grounded descriptor that integrates covalent and electrostatic contributions to reaction energetics.  Our findings reveal that excess surface charge can serve as a practical reactivity descriptor that directly correlates with C–C coupling activity and guides the rational design of more efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.", "date": "2025-07-04T13:05:19.328Z", "doi": "686504af3ba0887c332ee839"},

Using reactive molecular dynamics at constant potential, we reveal that ion-exchange membrane proximity anchors nanobubbles on Pt nanoparticles, preventing detachment while maintaining average steady-state hydrogen evolution currents indistinguishable from those of membrane-free systems. In contrast, direct ionomer adsorption onto the catalyst results in larger reduction of the current due to active site occlusion. Anchored nanobubbles locally displace interfacial water, creating dehydrated regions at the membrane interface that can accelerate chemical degradation pathways in anion-exchange membranes. By resolving nanobubble dynamics in the 1–2 nm confinement regime inaccessible to experiments, our results demonstrate that membrane proximity governs bubble confinement without compromising efficiency, reframing it as a design parameter for durability management in electrolysis systems.

In this study, we investigated the impact of alkali pretreatment on aluminosilicate structures in coal tailings and the subsequent implications for REE recovery during acid digestion. Pre-combustion coal refuse was treated with 5 M NaOH at varying solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratios (5, 50 g/L) and reaction times (5, 15 minutes), including a multi-step (five cycles) approach under microwave conditions. At 180◦C, XRD, 29Si NMR Spectroscopy and thermodynamic modeling show kaolinite transformation to hydrosodalite under high S/L ratios, while kaolinite completely dissolved under low S/L ratios. Conversely, quartz maintained crystallinity under both S/L ratios but slowly converted to amorphous silica over longer alkaline treatments. These alkaline pre-treatments resulted in greater REE extraction under acidic conditions. Light REE extraction was enhanced by a factor of ∼3 when kaolinite dissolved, but by a factor of ∼2 when kaolinite was converted to hydrosodalite; the heavy REEs (including Y) extractions were enhanced by ∼2 and ∼1.5, respectively, under the same conditions. Extending pre-treatment time from 5 to 15 minutes led to minimal enhancement in REE extraction, therefore kaolinite solubility due to low S/L ratio appears to be the primary factor in REE release. This alkaline pre-treatment also led to uranium removal prior to acid digestion, while correlation analyses showed that REE recovery was closely linked to simultaneous Mg, Ca, Fe, and Ti recovery.

Mechanistic investigations by DFT and multi-reference variational 2-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM)-CASSCF implicate a sulfur-based hydrogen evolution pathway in which the bridging 2-sulfides are rendered more basic by one-electron reduction, which populates a Mo-4d/S-3p based orbital with significant electron delocalization on the two 2-sulfides. Reduction and protonation of two adjacent Mo(2-S) moieties leads to H2 elimination with a low energy barrier of +20.2 kcal/mol. This pathway contrasts recent studies of stilbene hydrogenation by [Mo3S4Cl3(ImNH2)3]+, in which formation of the corresponding one-electron reduced 2-SH species via H2 splitting leads to spin density being shared across the MoIII centers.

Production of metal “super- hydrides” with a greater than 1:1 metal to hydrogen stoichiometry, produced by an electrochemical driving force in aqueous electrolyte, is experiencing emerging interest as a possible solution to this critical challenge. In this work, using palladium and its hydride (PdHx) as a model system, we combine state-of-the-art grand canonical density functional theory (DFT) and operando X-ray diffraction to investigate the feasibility and limitations of electrochemical hydrogen storage via formation of metal hydrides. We develop a unique computational model of PdHx with high granularity, particularly in the high loading (0.6 < x ≤1.0) regime. After benchmarking calculated lattice strain to operando X-ray diffraction measurements, we reveal that there is a signifi- cant energetic penalty to filling all six octahedral sites surrounding Pd, and that the well-known α−/β−PdHx coexistence is a macroscopic phenomenon. Using our com- putational model of PdHx, we calculate the bias-, coverage-, and loading-dependent activation barriers and reaction energies for the Volmer and Tafel reactions. Our find- ings reveal that dynamic changes in the activation barriers and reaction energies of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) sub-reactions impose an upper bound on electro- chemical hydrogen storage, well below theoretically predicted loadings via formation of superhydrides.

Inherent limitations imposed by the failure to capture multiscale behavior of water creates a dearth of simplified benchmarks for characterization. Broad analytical assessments that are capable of bridging disparate length scales, unifying  equilibrium isotherm types and identifying interaction mechanisms remain elusive.  To this end, the study herein provides a unified model and benchmark to explain wide ranging observations of water in carbon micropores.

The analysis successfully connects classical hydrophobic and hydrophilic features with isotherm types under stringent conditions of chemical and mechanical equilibrium. Affinity and hydrophobicity transforming effects of micropore size and functional site density are captured by the analysis that is vetted by blind and global isotherm prediction.

The challenge for PFAS removal is that it often requires a long time and high energy input to achieve high degradation efficiencies. This study reports a novel, ultrafast and effective method for degrading PFASs using the microdroplet technique. By forming microdroplets from PFAS solution spiked with oxidant such as sodium persulfate or Fenton’s reagent, a range of PFAS compounds including short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) such as PFPeA (C4F9COOH) were quickly degraded with degradation efficiency reaching 77-94%. The microdroplet reaction was completed in less than 1 ms under ambient conditions. In contrast, without oxidant, the microdroplet degradation efficiency was 10-17%. Also, incubating PFAS with the oxidant in bulk solution for 30 min resulted in < 8% degradation efficiency. It appears that the PFAS degradation rate can be accelerated by over 2 million times in oxidant-containing microdroplets in comparison with the bulk solution. Based on measured fluoride product concentrations, our result suggests that persulfate primarily facilitates PFAS degradation via the two-carbon degradation pathway, whereas Fenton’s reagent operates through the one-carbon degradation pathway.

The original cohesive energy density equation does not apply to ionic systems. So we modified this equation and developed a protocol for applying this modified equation to evaluate the influence of a salt. We did this by allocating salt effects to either the water or the denaturant, creating an \"effective\" cohesion parameter.

We demonstrate the influence of salts on hydrogen bonding, dispersion, polar forces, proton donor/acceptor ratio, dipole induction, orientation parameter, and electrostatic interactions during the denaturation process of DNA.   By analyzing independent experimental data, we demonstrate that salt affects electrostatic repulsion forces, with the most significant compensating attractive forces being dispersion forces.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to train automatically, avoiding the incredibly tedious process of constructing and extending traditional property estimation schemes. However, DNNs require large amounts of training data, are challenging to interpret, require large amounts of memory to load even during inference, and have severe difficulties incorporating qualitative chemical knowledge, which are often desired for molecular property prediction tasks. Here we present PySIDT (https://github.com/zadorlab/PySIDT), a software for training and running inference on Subgraph Isomorphic Decision Trees (SIDTs). SIDTs are graphbased decision trees made of nodes associated with molecular substructures. Inference is done by descending target molecular structures down the decision tree to nodes with matching subgraph isomorphic substructures and making predictions based on the final (most specific) node matched. SIDTs scale down well to dataset sizes much smaller than is feasible for DNNs. As trees of molecular substructures, SIDTs are inherently readable and easy to visualize, making them easy to analyze. They are also straightforward to extend and retrain, facilitate uncertainty estimation, and enable easy integration of expert knowledge. We demonstrate the SIDT approach discussing its application to a diverse range of molecular prediction tasks: rate coefficient estimation, diffusion coefficient estimation, thermochemistry estimation, transition state bond stretch prediction, pKa prediction, stability of molecular structures, stability of surface structures, and prediction of surface lateral interaction energetics. Additionally, we demonstrate the power of the SIDT algorithms in two direct learning curve vanilla comparisons with the popular DNN-based software Chemprop on enthalpy of formation and rate coefficient prediction tasks.

Conventional diffusion media, typically made from carbon fiber substrates with microporous layers, have been extensively post-treated to enhance performance; however, these approaches offer limited control over three-dimensional microstructure, particularly for advanced architectures with bimodal or gradient porosity – which can facilitate multiphase gas and liquid mass transport – and often rely on complex, multi-step processes. These limitations underscore the need for scalable, cost-effective fabrication methods capable of producing much broader geometrical features. Here, we introduce a scalable, bottom-up fabrication method based on non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) to produce carbon-based diffusion media with finely tunable microstructures. By systematically varying processing parameters, we generate thin, mechanically robust diffusion media with tailored in-plane and through-plane porosity, including isoporous and bimodal structures. Using microscopy, porosimetry, and electrochemical diagnostics, we correlate microstructural features with single-cell fuel cell performance, revealing their impact on water management and gas transport. We further demonstrate post-treatment strategies to enhance mass transport properties and benchmark the cost and scalability of NIPS fabrication against conventional carbon fiber-based diffusion media via technoeconomic analysis.

However, a major issue in the use of quinones for ECCS is reactivity with O2 in the reduced state. Unfortunately, quinones are also known to suffer from a trade-off between their redox-potential and strength of binding to CO2, such that in general, quinones which do not react with O2 do not react strongly enough with CO2 to be of use. In this work, computational methods are used to explore how the carbonyl positioning, as well as the ring structure, of quinones affects the associated trade-offs. Using a model based on Hückel theory we show that the redox-potential of quinones strongly depends on the change in aromaticity upon reduction. It is then shown that by changing the quinone ring structure, it is possible to tune the redox potential by approximately 0.8 V. Finally, one new type of quinone, 2,3-naphthoquinone, is predicted to be a particularly promising candidate for ECCS, and NMR spectroscopy is utilised to demonstrate it capturing CO2 in the dianion state.

While point-source carbon capture technologies have advanced, they remain confined to fixed emission sites and cannot address legacy emissions dispersed in the atmosphere. Direct air capture (DAC) offers a complementary strategy, but is constrained by the high energy costs of sorbent regeneration, especially under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological energy coupling, we developed a DAC system that thermodynamically links CO₂ binding with sorbent dissolution and release with sorbent recrystallization. Here we show that hexapodal amine sorbents, such as 2-PHA, enable efficient CO₂ capture from air at 0 °C and release at 40 °C using only mechanical stirring, with no external heating. The exothermic formation of carbamate and bicarbonate drives sorbent dissolution, effectively storing energy that is later recovered through crystallization to power CO₂ desorption. This reversible energy-coupling mechanism allows air-captured CO₂ to be enriched to >95% purity and fed directly into an electrochemical reactor. Using tailored electrocatalysts, the system converts CO₂ to CO or formate with up to 99% Faradaic efficiency; the resulting CO stream reaches 82% purity, suitable for direct ignition.

In recent years, physical or chemical vapor deposition have garnered interest to deposit catalyst films or particles on electrode surfaces, to circumvent the complications associated with the use of inks. Samples prepared this way are often incompatible with standard equipment (rotating disk electrodes, RDEs) to assess the effect of mass transport on the electrode performance. Herein, we present a custom-built adapter designed to test samples prepared by physical deposition methods in a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup. Using an outer-sphere redox probe (K4Fe(CN)6), we demonstrate that the custom-built adapter provides mass transport conditions comparable to those obtained with a standard disk electrode in a classic RDE setup. We then use the adapter to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of model Pt electrodes, i.e., sputter-deposited Pt thin films and thermally “dewetted” Pt NPs, in acid electrolytes. Under both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions, the Pt NPs show significantly higher HER kinetics compared to Pt thin films. The results indicate that the enhanced HER activity observed for dewetted Pt NPs is intrinsic and of a kinetic nature, likely linked to catalyst/support interactions, and it is not a consequence of mass transport effects.", "date": "2025-06-30T10:59:02.741Z", "doi": "685d9d1cc1cb1ecda08c617a"},

Detailed Density Functional Theory computational work and extensive  experimental studies support a mechanism with homolytic aromatic substitution character, wherein electrophilic attack of the arene  system initiates N-C bond formation, but use of electrons from the Mo≡N triple bond completes the bond formation through an open-shell singlet transition state that formally reduces the metal center to Mo(V) and imbues the arene ring with significant radical character. This transition state is enthalpically 15 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than the classical “Wheland-type” transition state common to electrophilic aromatic substitution paths proposed in related systems. Subsequent intramolecular transfer of the arene hydrogen to the imido nitrogen atom leads to the cationic Mo(IV) anilido complex [[ArMoIV]-NHPh]+, which rapidily reacts with available [[ArMoVI]≡N]+ by a proton-coupled electron transfer step to generate the observed 1 : 1 mixture of imido products [[ArMo(V)]=NR]+ (R = H; PhX, X = H, o,m,p-F). This second phase of the mechanism is also supported computationally and by an experimental crossover experiment and is driven by significant coordination-induced bond weakening (CIBW) in the N-H bond of the [[ArMoIV]-NHPh]+ and the lack of CIBW in the imido N-H product. The novel mechanism of C-H addition to the electrophilic terminal nitrido opens new low energy pathways for the development of systems capable of catalytic nitrogen atom transfer to C-H bonds.

This review focuses on recent advances in optical spectroscopy and imaging techniques—including fluorescence imaging, vibrational Stark spectroscopy, electrochromism, sum-frequency generation, and high-resolution Raman micro-spectroscopy—that have successfully enabled the detection of interfacial electric fields on different hydrophobic water interfaces (air, liquid and solid). We summarize how both probe-based and label-free optical spectroscopic techniques can consistently quantify the on-water electric field strengths to be on order of tens of MV/cm, corroborated by independent non-spectroscopic techniques, such as electrokinetic and surface charge measurements. The surprisingly close agreement among these different measurements and across broad experimental systems strongly hints the existence of strong electric fields being a general feature of water-hydrophobe interfaces.

Numerous studies have added mechanistic insights from first-principles; however, they have generally been limited to analyzing kinetics in acid.  \nHere, we use constant-potential DFT coupled with Gaussian process-based transition state search to compile microkinetic models for alkaline HER. Accounting for both non-Nernstian effects and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, we reproduce experimental activity trends, as well as outliers in the conventional volcano. Relating activities to descriptors, we find that both refining the traditional descriptor with catalyst surface charge information and applying the H binding strength in the (generally) unfavorable top-site exhibit largely improved predictive power for exchange current densities.  This stems from their ability to capture trends in the kinetics of electrochemical hydrogen adsorption, the rate-limiting step on all investigated surfaces, as a consequence of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.  However, these descriptors are not applicable in predicting trends in the kinetics of non-electrochemical H2-desorption, which instead follow the difference in binding strengths between fcc- and top-sites and an effective electronic coupling term.\nCombining all identified descriptors, we define novel activity volcanoes, which can aid screening for abundant and active HER catalysts.

As demand for REEs surges, scalable extraction strategies that operate effectively in ultra-dilute concentration regimes, such as those found in produced water, mine tailings, and geothermal brines, are essential for unlocking new domestic and unconventional sources of critical minerals. Magnetic fields have been largely dismissed as too weak to drive selective and sustained ion transport in solution in the absence of other chemical and electrochemical forces. Here, we demonstrate that inhomogeneous magnetic field gradients alone, without applied electric fields, induce long-range, directed transport and spatial redistribution of solvated lanthanide ions. High-resolution Mach–Zehnder interferometry reveals the emergence of concentration waves and sustained ion enrichment, uncovering a dynamic force balance between magnetic drift and other forces in solution. These spatiotemporal observations are supported by a modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) model that incorporates magnetic drift, standard diffusion, and charge imbalance forces. Such magnetically driven non-equilibrium mechanism elevates near-surface concentrations to 3–4 times above bulk values, forming condensed ionic domains that not only shift the local electrochemical potential of paramagnetic species but also trigger crystallization of well-defined dysprosium oxalate crystals at the magnetized interface. These newly observed phenomena unlock a powerful, field-responsive strategy for actively sculpting interfacial energetics, expanding beyond traditional chemical functionalization and opening new avenues for controlling ionic behavior at the nanoscale.

For the first time, we systematically examine how concentrated electrolyte affects the thermodynamics of TM electrodeposition by combining experimental, theoretical, and computational methods. Our study revealed that the electrodeposition potential (Eeq) of a wide range of TMs (Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn) is strongly dependent on electrolyte concentration. The classical thermodynamic model, the Nernst equation, cannot quantify such concentration dependence due to its neglect of metal-anion complexation, a unique structural feature of concentrated aqueous electrolytes of TM ions due to their strong cation-anion interaction. By examining the energy landscape of the electrodeposition reaction and the complex formation equilibria, we derived a chemistry-agonistic physical model that successfully predicts Eeq in a wide range of concentrated electrolytes and for representative TMs. A unified thermodynamic framework of metal deposition is proposed by generalizing our model, which reduces to previously proposed models under limiting conditions and covers electrodeposition from dilute electrolyte to molten salt electrolyte.

Rahman Pejman", "Madhuri Deb", "Ayman Rouf", "Han Almekinders"], "abstract": "Self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED) enables uniform and conformal coatings by leveraging charge accumulation to naturally restrict film growth. However, scaling SLED to industrially relevant rates remains challenging due to the onset of inertial effects at higher flow conditions, which disrupt electrostatic steering and lead to non-uniform deposition. In this work, we demonstrate that high-flow electrospray emitters can maintain SLED behavior up to ~5 mL/h per tip, achieving over an order of magnitude increase in throughput compared to traditional needle-based systems. At these flow rates, PMMA coatings exhibit asymptotic thicknesses near 4–5 µm, and complex 3D objects can be conformally coated in under two hours. Beyond this regime, deposition patterns become increasingly anisotropic, forming bullseye profiles and uncoated zones due to momentum-dominated droplet behavior. To counteract this, we apply a secondary bias to the spray target, which reduces the local electric field and mitigates inertial overshoot. This approach significantly improves coating uniformity and restores SLED-like behavior even at total flow rates up to 12–15 mL/h. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that electric field shaping via secondary biasing provides a scalable and effective method to suppress inertial effects. Our findings offer a practical route to high-throughput, uniform electrospray coatings and lay the foundation for future developments in field-controlled deposition techniques for additive manufacturing and surface engineering.

In this work, degradation behaviors of TiO2 photoanodes are characterized under different photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Operando inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that TiO2 undergoes dissolution under illumination and remains stable in the dark. Depending on the electrolyte pH, different degradation mechanisms are identified, and a model is proposed to correlate PEC performance degradation with TiO2 dissolution. In 1 M HClO4, TiO2 dissolves continuously under illumination, leading to persistent degradation of PEC performance. In 0.1 M HClO4, the PEC performance becomes stable after the photo-dissolution reaches saturation. In 0.1 M KOH, little PEC degradation is observed, while small amount of photo-dissolution is accompanied by redeposition of anatase-type TiO2 nanoparticles. In 1 M KOH, photo-dissolution is accompanied by redeposition of an amorphous layer with reduced oxidation state TiO2-x, which blocks surface active sites and causes significant PEC degradation.

An antimicrobial mouthwash must therefore serve two opposing purposes. On the one hand, it must prevent the overgrowth of microbes, especially pathogenic bacteria, that is, it must kill these microbes. On the other hand, it has to maintain a renewable oral flora of useful bacteria, and for this you have to save at least some of these bacteria. According to published experimental data, which are cited in this article, mouthwash based on pure chlorine dioxide has proven to be able to do this. In our series of articles, we examine what models/mechanisms can explain that mouthwash containing pure chlorine dioxide is able to meet these seemingly contradictory requirements. In addition to reviewing the literature data, we also raise rational hypotheses, which will have to be verified with further scientific and clinical studies in the future. \nIn the first part of our series, we give a general overview of the experimental results published so far, as well as the possible mechanisms of the selectivity of chlorine dioxide. Based on experimental data and theoretical considerations, we point out that pure chlorine dioxide mouthwash has practically no effect on the mucous membrane, but it does affect the bacterial flora of the oral cavity. According to published data, a significant proportion of bacteria survive oral rinses, and rinsing kills pathogenic microbes more effectively than others. The latter can be explained by colonization resistance. Then, with the help of a model calculation based on the diffusion of ClO2 in plaque, we show that the majority of dental plaque bacteria cannot survive a 15-second mouth rinse with mouthwash containing 15 ppm ClO2. In other words, although the survival of a significant proportion of bacteria is obviously enabled by an oral biofilm, dental plaque cannot do so.

Therefore, there is much interest in its quantification. For basic research, typically low concentrations need to be quantified. In this paper, we evaluate a potentiometric method based on a gas-selective electrode (GSE) for online quantification of ammonia in an alkaline electrolyte. Boron-doped nanodiamond (B-ND) is used as a test case for electrocatalytic ammonia production from nitrate (NO3RR) using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) setup and for ammonia production from nitric oxide (NORR) in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup. The parameters of the calibration curve are predictable and agree well with the measurements. The lower limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) are determined as 0.57 µM and 1.36 µM. The yield rate and Faradaic efficiency of the test cases are 2.17 ± 0.23 nmol/s/cm2 and 42.1 ± 4.5% for NO3RR using the RDE as well as 0.53 ± 0.02 nmol/s/cm2  and 10.2 ± 2.9% for NORR using the GDE.

However, there remains a key need for a robust and contamination-free membrane, including systematic assessments of its electrochemical suitability for this reaction. Here, we report a simple yet effective cleaning process for the recently introduced microporous Celgard membrane.

{"title": "Curvature effects regulate the oxygen evolution reaction performance of M-NC single-atom site catalysts: A theoretical study", "authors": ["Wenming Sun", "Jing Meng", "Ziwen Zhang"], "abstract": "This study involved the construction of M-(n,n)NC single-atom site catalyst models on armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes with different curvatures (n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, Au.). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to analyze the free energy and electronic structure of these catalysts, systematically investigating the impact of curvature on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of M-(n,n)NC single-atom site catalysts. Through the systematic evaluation of the catalytic performance, 12 high-performance M-(n,n)NC catalysts were identified, namely Rh-(n,n)NC (n = 5~10), Fe-(n,n)NC (n = 6~10), and Co-(5,5)NC. Among them, five Fe-(n,n)NC (n = 6~10) catalysts with high catalytic activity and lower metal costs are recommended as the preferred candidates for OER catalysts. Electronic structure analysis reveals that curvature induces splitting and energy level shifts in the metal d orbitals, which exhibit a certain regularity corresponding to the systematic variation in curvature. The selective coupling of oxygen-containing intermediates (O, OH, OOH) with the metal d orbitals in M-(n,n)NC catalysts is also modulated by curvature, further influencing the adsorption capacity of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface. Consequently, M-(n,n)NC catalysts with different curvatures exhibit distinct trends in catalytic performance. Furthermore, this study investigated the correlation between the metal z-direction-related d-orbitals (dz2, dzy, and dzx) and catalytic performance, revealing that the spin-down dzy band center value can serve as a simple descriptor for M-(n,n)NC catalysts. This study provides a theoretical basis for designing efficient OER catalysts, highlighting the potential of optimizing catalyst performance by adjusting curvature.

Here, we introduce an operando neutron imaging methodology – combining polarized and transmission modes – to simultaneously track iron plating/stripping and hydrogen evolution. We uncover preferential iron deposition near the membrane indicating a non-uniform current density distribution. We find that pH plays a major role in reaction selectivity and cycling performance, where less acidic pH results in inaccessible iron deposits. Our experiments with different flow field geometries show that both reaction selectivity and spatial distribution are strongly influenced by electrolyte flow patterns.

This versatile platform facilitates rapid access to a diverse array of fluorinated block copolymers by incorporating various classes of vinyl monomers.

In this study, we integrate MB-nrg data-driven many-body potential energy functions with advanced quantum dynamics simulations to uncover how many-body interactions and NQEs shape the structure and vibrational response of hydrated fluoride. Our analysis reveals that short-range three-body interactions between the ion and surrounding water molecules are critical for capturing the infrared spectral features of the first hydration shell, particularly in the OH-stretch and libration regions. We identify distinct reorientation dynamics of OH bonds that give rise to the bifurcation of the libration band.
